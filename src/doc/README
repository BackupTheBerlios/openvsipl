Introduction
============

  Manuals for Sourcery VSIPL++ are written using DocBook.  For more
  information about DocBook, see:

    http://www.docbook.org

  The DocBook input is processed using XSLT to generate documentation
  in both HTML and PDF formats.

Organization
============

  Each manual is placed in its own subdirectory of "doc".  Some common
  fragments, as well as common build tools are pulled in from an external 
  csl-docbook tree. Use the --with-csl-docbook configure option to specify 
  its location.

Common entities
---------------

  Common entities are provided by extending the DocBook document type via
  csldoc.dtd. As some of those entities depend on configure options, this
  file is generated during configuration.

Cross-referencing
-----------------

  Manuals may link into each other. In order to support this, a 'sitemap' is
  generated, containing all possible link targets of the set of documents.
  Then, this sitemap is used during output generation to look up external references.
  

Conventions
===========

  Pronouns
  --------
   
  The user is referred to as "you".  The first person ("I" or "we") is
  never used; refer to CodeSourcery as "CodeSourcery".
 
  Indentation
  -----------
  
  Nested elements are indented one column from their containing
  elements.

  FIXMEs
  ------

  If you must check in documentation that is incomplete or incorrect,
  please mark the areas that need to be fixed with a <note> whose
  <title> is "FIXME".  For example:

    <note>
     <title>FIXME</title>
     <para>An example is needed here.</para>
    </note>

  Adoping this convention uniformly makes it easier to search for
  places that require fixing.
